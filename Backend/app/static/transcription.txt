## Finding a New Path

**Leaving the Familiar**

Before one can leave the situation they are in, they must believe that another path exists. This belief is crucial, as it provides the motivation and hope necessary to take the first step towards change. 

**Beyond Sight**

This belief doesn't always come from seeing a clear and obvious path. Sometimes, it arises from a deep inner trust, a sense that something better awaits, even if the specifics remain unclear. It's about having faith in the unknown, trusting that a brighter future is possible.
