## The Power of Perseverance

### Turning Points

Everyone has a turning point in their life. A moment where they can choose to move forward or give up. The key thing to remember before surrendering is that quitting guarantees failure. There is no chance of success if you stop trying.  

### The Promise of Persistence

The only way to keep the possibility of achieving your goals alive is to never give up, no matter how difficult things become.  Persistence is the key to overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving your dreams.
