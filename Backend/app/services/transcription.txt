##  Embrace the Challenge, Reap the Rewards

**Staying Comfortable, Staying Stuck**

If you stay in bed, on the couch, or in your comfort zone, and only do what is easy, your life will be hard. You may feel safe and comfortable in the short term, but this approach will limit your growth and potential. 

**Challenge Yourself, Achieve Greatness**

However, if you are willing to do what is hard, to get up, go, and be relentless, your life will be much easier in the long run.  By pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will unlock new skills, opportunities, and experiences. 

**Hard Work Pays Off**

Working hard while others are slacking off will put you ahead of the curve.  The effort you put in today will pay off in the future with greater success, satisfaction, and fulfillment. So, embrace the challenge, get out of your comfort zone, and work hard.  The rewards will be worth it.
