##  The Power of Dreams

**The Dream Within**

I don't know what that dream is that you have. I don't care how disappointing it might have been, as you've been working towards that breath. 

**Hold Onto Hope**

But that dream that you're holding in your mind, that it's possible, that's what matters. Even if your path has been filled with setbacks and frustrations, holding onto the belief that your dream is achievable is crucial.
